# DASDS
Driver automobile and safety detection system [First place STEM competition]

## System Environments
Our system will be implemented in modern cars. It will make use of cameras and OBD II to guarantee the drivers safety. We will require 2 cameras for: 

1- OCR detection of license for guest users  
2- Detecting facial motions for sleepy or distracted drivers 
3- Detection of drunk drivers using MQ3 sensor

## System Architecture 

System Architectures are an essential part of developing and maintaining systems primarily because they are like blueprints of a software.
